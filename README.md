# BeddyBus
Matt the Goat wants to sleep on the bus

#New Features We need To Build
**-##Schedule ###(Fragment)
  -Pull In Public Transport Schedule
  -Focus on the NYC Area and Academy see if we can generify it to do elsewhere
  -Click on stop and set alarm based on stop's location

**-##Settings ###(Fragment)
  -Customize time window for alarm activiation
    --eg 5mins before stop, or 10mins or X_mins
  -Color Schemes? sounds lame, but like, all you JOE

**-##Paywall in stead of Buy
  -Got to see how that works but lets set up blocking settings and Schedule fragments unless they pay for the full access just in case
   -(Don't want to pay for adsense...)

**-##Alarm Sound and App Image
  -We need to change that before we put it on the app store to something not copywrited
  -Hey Mike, want to share some of those tasty jams you make? We could use those




**-##Code Refactor
  -Junks a mess, if should clean it up so when we publish it's easier to support
